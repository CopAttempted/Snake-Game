# Snake Game!
This is a simple Snake game implemented in Python3 using the Turtle graphics library. The game is designed to be lightweight and easy to play in your whatever-windows manager. It's a fun project to practice your Python skills or just to enjoy some nostalgic gaming moments.
## PrerequisitesBefore running the game, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python 3- Tkinter (for GUI)- Turtle graphics library
You can install Tkinter and Turtle graphics library using the following commands:

# For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
# For macOS with Homebrew
brew install python-tk
# For Windows, Tkinter is included with Python by default.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:```bash
git clone https://github.com/CopAttempted/Snake-Game```

2. Change to the project directory:
```cd Snake-Game```

4. Run the game:
5. ```python3 main.py```

6. ## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
- Your goal is to eat the food (represented as a green square) that appears on the screen.
- The snake will grow longer each time it eats food.
- Avoid running into the walls or colliding with the snake's own body, as that will end the game.
